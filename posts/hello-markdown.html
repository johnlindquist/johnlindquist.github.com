I&#39;m 6&#39;3&quot; and weigh 217. I also know all the measurements for my chest, belly, arms, and legs, but that&#39;s a story for another day.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been fat. I think about 330lbs, but I was too ashamed to get on a scale. When I decided to do something about it, I started running (well, walking, then jogging, then running). I ate better, but I honestly have no idea exactly what I ate. I remember trying a couple of quick-fix diets which made me way too hungry, so I just stuck to eating better and running more. Over the years, I started playing basketball and lifting weights. All this exercise worked and I made my way down to the 230lbs. I felt great, then I broke my wrist.</p>
<p>A broken wrist was a big setback. I turned to food for comfort for a few months and put on a good 20lbs or so. Clothes were getting tight and I was pretty ticked with myself. My wrist cast came off, so it was time to get back to work. It was slow going. Weak wrists and arms didn&#39;t help with lifting or basketball (you try not moving your wrist for 4 months then shooting a free throw and tell me how it goes). I was determined, yet still frustrated. I was having a really hard time losing weight this time around (I felt stuck around 240), so it was time to get serious.</p>
<h2>What?</h2><p>Leonard, a friend with a hard-earned body that looks like a superhero, challenged me to track my food. I mentioned to him that I was having a hard time getting over these food cravings, so he said, &quot;Every time you crave something, add it to a list. After 8 weeks of tracking food, eat everything on that list on one day&quot;. He laid out a simple plan for me to track against. Higher carbs on lifting days (fruits, grains, fish, birds, veggies), higher fats (veggies, nuts, pigs, cows) on rest days. Simply live by the &quot;if it fits your macros of carbs, fat, protein for the day, you can eat it&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve made it 8 weeks. Tomorrow is my &quot;Epic Cheat Day&quot; where I get to eat everything on my cravings list. I&#39;m going to log everything I eat, maybe even take pictures. Why am I doing it then? Because it was part of the plan. I&#39;m a little scared, because I know it will set me back from the progress I&#39;ve made. I&#39;ve lost 4&quot; off my belly, lost 14lbs, and I&#39;m getting much stronger. I have more ambitious goals to reach by the end of the year, so I&#39;ll follow up on those when I get there.
Here are some things I&#39;ve learned about myself in the process that I wanted to share.</p>
<h2>10 Things I&#39;ve Learned</h2><p><strong>1.    You get stronger every time you say &quot;no&quot;</strong></p>
<p>   It&#39;s not like the temptations or go away, but I did seem to develop a greater willpower to say &quot;no&quot; the more I did it. Health requires a ton of effort and patience.</p>
<p><strong>2.    Hunger is worse than cravings</strong></p>
<p>   Want that cookie? What other food are you willing to sacrifice to eat it? I started to identify &quot;junk&quot; food as food that literally wasted carbs and fat away in my macro budget. Junk food becomes way less appealing if you&#39;re going to have to go hungry the rest of the day (and we all know how junk food just makes you want to eat more junk food).</p>
<p><strong>3.    Inches Are Better than Pounds</strong></p>
<p>   You can feel your belly getting smaller. You can feel your clothes getting looser. I haven&#39;t really felt lighter. I&#39;m learning to focus more on measurements and photos than actual pounds on a scale.</p>
<p><strong>4.    I Don&#39;t Enjoy Cooking or Meal Planning</strong></p>
<p>   I&#39;ve never enjoyed using a recipe to throw a meal together and a stricter diet didn&#39;t help. I&#39;m fine with tossing some fish in the fridge in the morning to thaw throughout the day then bake for dinner, but that&#39;s about the maximum effort I&#39;m willing to put into it. I still pretty much eat what I can find based on what my macros allowed for the day. Unfortunately, I often end up a 5pm (or earlier) having already eaten my allowed macros, then I&#39;d just have to make it to the end of the day. That might sound bad, but I&#39;m used to it and it works for me.</p>
<p><strong>5.    I&#39;m lucky I love fish</strong></p>
<p>   I rediscovered my love for fish because my macros pretty much forced me into it. My wife hates the smell and my kids don&#39;t eat it, so this was a solo effort. If you&#39;re okay with fish, shrimp, etc and just tossing it in with some greens and a tiny drizzle of dressing, then you&#39;re good to go. Otherwise, you&#39;d better love birds.</p>
<p><strong>6.    Tracking Food Becomes a Habit</strong></p>
<p>   I almost subconsciously reach for my phone to log my food whenever I eat now. It was a huge concerted effort when I start, but now it&#39;s natural. Although, it does add another level of &quot;Where&#39;s my phone?&quot; throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>7.    Let Numbers Be Your Guide</strong></p>
<p>   Having choice is hard. Having choice without restrictions to reign you in can lead to disaster. Having specific numbers to try and reach my goal gives me a sense of accomplishment each day that &quot;I did something good for myself today&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>8.    Knowing What You Eat is the Foundation of Health</strong></p>
<p>   Sugar somehow has the magic ability to shut down your brain and force you into a zombie-like eating state. Mindlessly eating (not eating minds, that&#39;s real zombies) is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p><strong>9.    Putting Food Back is Hard</strong></p>
<p>   It&#39;s difficult to reach into the pantry, read a food label, realize you can&#39;t eat something you want, then put it back. Same with measuring food on a food scale. If you pour out too much, you&#39;ve got to put some back. It&#39;s hard, but necessary.</p>
<p><strong>10.    Serving Sizes Are Tiny</strong></p>
<p>   Using a food scale on every meal is an eye-opening experience if you&#39;re like me and you&#39;ve always simply eaten until you were full. Luckily, over time, your stomach (the organ) shrinks back down to a normal size and you get fuller faster, but you do have to readjust by going through periods of hunger. It&#39;s hard, deal with it.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2><p>I&#39;ll follow-up at the end of the year. There will be lots of pictures and data to scour through. I talk to Leonard all the time about progress and planning. For now, I&#39;m just going to stay the course until I hit my goals.</p></div><div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-3 aside"><p><strong>John Lindquist</strong></p><p>Head Egg at http://egghead.io</p><p>Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/johnlindquist">@johnlindquist</a></p></div></div></div></article><hr><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><p><small>&copy; 2013 johnlindquist.com</small></p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><p class="pull-right"><small><a href="/rss.xml" title="johnlindquist.com RSS feed"><img src="/assets/images/feed-icon.png" class="rss-feed"/> RSS feed</a></small></p></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
